# machine_learning_scatterplot_generation
### This repository contains code to create large scale scatterplot data for neural network training and classification. Classes are manually generated with the available parameters such that each new class creates and stores the image data in it's own folder and auto-generates a CSV file for the dataset labels and image paths.

This repository uses the following libraries:

*matplotlib* for its pyplot class for all scatterplot generation

*sympy* for creating and solving random polynomial equations with a guassian random noise distribution for the line plot

*sklearn* for generating grouping plots

*numpy* for array manipulation

*csv* for creating and exporting csv file information
